Forbidden
=============================

The 403 (Forbidden) status code indicates that the server understood
the request but refuses to authorize it.  A server that wishes to
make public why the request has been forbidden can describe that
reason in the response payload (if any).

If authentication credentials were provided in the request, the
server considers them insufficient to grant access.  The client
SHOULD NOT automatically repeat the request with the same
credentials.  The client MAY repeat the request with new or different
credentials.  However, a request might be forbidden for reasons
unrelated to the credentials.
