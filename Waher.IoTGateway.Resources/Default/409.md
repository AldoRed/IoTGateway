Conflict
=============================

The 409 (Conflict) status code indicates that the request could not
be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the target
resource.  This code is used in situations where the user might be
able to resolve the conflict and resubmit the request.  The server
SHOULD generate a payload that includes enough information for a user
to recognize the source of the conflict.
