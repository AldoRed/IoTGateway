URI Too Long
=============================

The 414 (URI Too Long) status code indicates that the server is
refusing to service the request because the request-target is longer 
than the server is willing to interpret. This rare condition is only 
likely to occur when a client has improperly converted a POST request 
to a GET request with long query information, when the client has 
descended into a "black hole" of redirection (e.g., a redirected 
URI prefix that points to a suffix of itself) or when the server 
is under attack by a client attempting to exploit potential security holes.
