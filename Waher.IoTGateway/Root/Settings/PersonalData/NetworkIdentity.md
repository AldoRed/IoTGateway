Network identity
------------------

When connecting to the network, *{{ApplicationName}}* will use a network identity. (In coming pages, you will create such an identity.) This 
identity, together with its credentials, any public profile you wish to give it, your authorized contacts, and what groups they belong to, will 
be stored on the *broker* you choose. The broker uses this information to help protect you, and limit who is authorized to send messages to your
machine. Make sure this broker handles personal data securely. These credentials are also initially used for logging in to any administrative 
pages of *{{ApplicationName}}*. You can change these keys when you want.
