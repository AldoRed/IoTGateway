XMPP Communication
===========================

On this page, you can follow the [XMPP](https://xmpp.org/) communication made from the machine (as a client) to its (parent) broker.
The sniffer will automatically be terminated after some time to avoid performance degradation and leaks. Sniffers should only be
used as a tool for troubleshooting.
